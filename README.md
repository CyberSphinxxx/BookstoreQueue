# Bookstore Queue
This Python script simulates a simple queue management system for a bookstore.

It allows users to enter the bookstore, join a queue, and buy books.

The system is implemented using a deque (double-ended queue) from Python's collections module.

It's beginner-friendly and illustrates fundamental queue principles.

# Features
- Enter the Bookstore: Users can enter the bookstore and specify the number of persons to buy books.
- Join Queue: Upon entering, users are added to a queue.
- Buy a Book: Users can buy books in the order they joined the queue.
- Leave: Users can choose to exit the bookstore.
